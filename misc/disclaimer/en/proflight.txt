Hi!

Be careful with the settings, you can permanently damage your DRONE.
DO NOT USE with mountain environement.
Keep in mind than your are responsible of your fly and than the firmware can be responsible of crash if you change wrong settings.
If you wana use the new rescue mode you can't use less than 57600 or 10 hz and have good results.
You need to set magnometer flag at flash and enable gps and barometer features.

Have a nice fly.
